        <p> <div class="Bold-Content"> <b> Focused. Creative. Thinker.
        </div><br>

It took me four years of studying Electronic Media Broadcast for me to decide that Advertising and Marketing was the field I truly wanted to be in. I am fortunate enough to be able to still apply all that I learned in my major to my career. I am driven to continue to grow and succeed in my career and always looking for a challenge. <br><br>

â€‹Outside of work you can find me most likely on a run; training for a race, with friends at a local brewery, hanging wit my little sister (BBBS) or eating Chop't while binge watching Mad Men or Parks and Recreation for the fourth time (it is all about balance...right?).
